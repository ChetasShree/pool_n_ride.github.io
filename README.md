## About Our project üîß

Transportation is a major issue these days especially in India. One of the most used means of communication in roadways. One of the major forms of road transport consists of the private passenger car.These cars are generally used with only a single rider. Because of these causes pollution, traffic congestion (Jam), increasing parking space, wastage of time, no new connections & many more. Now a days, there is no. of application are in used but they are working in some bounded area. So, we have to remove the boundary through our application. We are developing the application which is working as like social networking sites. It is touch of everyone those have smart phones. This app is working as social networking site so the security is big issue. We have trace this problem by providing various security advance facilities such as for SOS we have developed a technique which can be used when the passenger or driver is in trouble.

### PLAN OF ACTION : 
‚Ä¢ Registration for users for security. <br>
‚Ä¢ Provides pool details to the user. <br>
‚Ä¢ Can create his/her own pool. <br>
‚Ä¢ Approval/Disapproval totally depends on driver. <br>
‚Ä¢ User-Friendly. <br>
‚Ä¢ Blind can also operate it. <br>
‚Ä¢ Track the location till the pool is made. <br>
‚Ä¢ Carpooling head-office track each & every pool. <br>
‚Ä¢ it helpful to take action if someone is in trouble <br>

### ISSUES SOLVED : 
‚Ä¢ It helps in reducing traffic congestion as number of vehicles on the road can be reduced significantly. <br>
‚Ä¢ Miles of travel of a particular vehicle and emission of gases by the vehicles can also be reduced. <br>
‚Ä¢ As the system aims at the empty seats it increase vehicle occupancy. <br>
‚Ä¢ More efficient land use as parking requirement is educed. Thus also helps in saving cost of building and maintaining infrastructure. <br>
